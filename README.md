Developed using Python and multiple data science libraries (SciKit-Learn, NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, MatPlotLib), this program predicts whether or not an NBA player would make an all-NBA team based on multiple per-game stats, such as points, rebounds, and assists, as well as advanced stats including PER (Player Efficiency Rating) and VORP (Value Over Replacement Player). The training and testing data is derived from the 2015-2021 NBA seasons. The algorithm used to train the data is an SVM algorithm with a linear kernel.
